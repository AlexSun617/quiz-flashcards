TITLE: Sample Study Deck

Q: Which OSI layer is responsible for routing packets between networks?
A) Data Link (Layer 2)
B) Network (Layer 3)
C) Transport (Layer 4)
D) Session (Layer 5)
ANS: B
EXPL: Routing is a Layer 3 (Network layer) function. Routers forward packets between networks based on IP addressing.

Q: Select TWO properties of a link-state routing protocol.
A) Builds a full topology map of the network
B) Uses periodic full routing table broadcasts to neighbors
C) Runs SPF (Dijkstra) to compute best paths
D) Only shares routes with directly connected networks
ANS: A,C
EXPL: Link-state protocols flood link-state info so routers build a topology database, then run SPF to compute shortest paths.
